  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>My name is Caroline Miranda, I am a marketing professional and web designer from Salvador, Bahia, Brazil currently living in Dublin, Ireland.
In childhood I had more fun coming up with new games than actually playing them. Today, I channels all my creativity and inventiveness to turn good ideas into great projects. I am also a researcher on OBEC (Monitoring Centre for Creative Economy) of Universidade Federal da Bahia / Brazil.
I currentlyenrolled in online courses (CodeSchool) to improve my knowledge in HTML and CSSand I also keep myself informed about the latest developments in ProductDesign.
